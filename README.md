# Installing
Make sure you are inside the repository folder.
### Virtual environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment, where 'name' is the name you want, without quotes.
```
python -m venv 'name'
```
Activate the virtual environment where 'name' is the name from the previous step.
```
source name/bin/activate
```
### Installing dependencies
Use the `pip install -r` command to install the dependencies of the "requirements.txt" document.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Using Pomodoro timer
To run the script simply use `sudo` (make sure you are in a virtual environment):
```
sudo python timer_flet.py
```
You can also use Flet commands to run the timer:
```
flet run timer_flet.py
```

Remember to use the `deactivate` command when you finish using the timer to exit virtual environment.
